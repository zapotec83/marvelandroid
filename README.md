# MarvelAndroid
Simple Android project to use the public Marvel API + RxJava/Coroutines + MVVM + Kotlin

## Introduction
This project was developed to test the consumption of Marvel API using [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android/) as Dependency Injector.

## Project
The project was developed in Kotlin using a Domain/Data/Presentation architecture with MVVM for the presentation layer and Repository for the Data layer.
It also includes the use of RxJava and Coroutines for both reactive programming and async tasks.

## TODO
Implement paggining library from Android [Paggining](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) to manage paggining in a correct way instead of "homemade"
Implement Room to be able to use it as a kid of "internal cache" to avoid so many REST WS requests
Highly improve UI...
